## Regarding Task Submission
Hope you all are now comfortable with Git and GitHub. 
Now you will be given daily tasks on the basis of the topics taught on that particular day. You need to submit those tasks.

## Steps for submitting the tasks:
1. Fork the repo
2. Make the new branch of your name in the repo.
3. Commit the files 
4. Create a new pull request 

## Points to be followed:
1. Make a seperate folder for each task. 
2. That folder should contain all the files of that task. 
3. Follow folder name format.

The folder name of the task should be:
### E.g. 12-09-2021_DS_Task-1_Ansh_Gaikwad
In this folder all files of the respective task must be present. These tasks are a part of your continuous evaluation throughout the workshop. All the best! âœ¨
